# Vimeo_React_Challenge

This project was created for Vimeo by Jack Nichols (Stanford '19) as part of a Coding Challenge.

To run locally:
1. download the repository to a local directory
2. use a web browser to load "layout.html"
3. (if re-compiling JavaScript is necessary) run "npm install" in the directory
4. (if re-compiling JavaScript is necessary) run "npm run build" in the directory

The main files of interest are layout.html, layout.jsx, and layout.css

With any questions or concerns, please email nichoj10@stanford.edu
