# Vimeo_React_Challenge

This project was created for Vimeo by Jack Nichols (Stanford '19) as part of a Coding Challenge.

To run locally:

download the repository to a local directory
use a web browser to load "layout.html"
(if re-compiling JavaScript is necessary) run "npm install" in the directory
(if re-compiling JavaScript is necessary) run "npm run build" in the directory
The main files of interest are layout.html, layout.jsx, and layout.css

With any questions or concerns, please email nichoj10@stanford.edu
